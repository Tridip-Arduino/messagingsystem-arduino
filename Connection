Connect LCD to Arduino Like given in Photo, So the A0 pin connected to the 16th Pin of LCD.

16th pin of LED ------> 1st pin of LCD

2nd pin of LCD -------> +5v of Arduino

3rd Pin of LCD --------> GND of Arduino

4rth pin of LCD --------> 5th pin of Arduino

5th pin of LCD ---------> 4rth pin of Arduino

6th pin of LCD ---------> 3rd pin of Arduino
                 
                 
                 

Mine Bluetooth Works on 3.3v to 6v, So I will connect it to 3.3v of Arduino.

Vcc of Bluetooth --------> 3.3v of Arduino

Gnd of Bluetooth --------> Gnd of Arduino

Tx of Bluetooth --------> Rx of Arduino

Rx of Bluetooth ---------> Tx of Arduino




Connect your Arduino to Power supply

the red LED in Bluetooth will starts fast blinking it means it is not connected to any device.

Turn on the Bluetooth in your device.
Search for new device.
Click on Hc05 once it appear.
Enter the password "1234" or "0000".
